<br>jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery comes in the form of a single .js file that you link to from your webpage. Your JavaScript code then accesses the library by calling various jQuery functions.
<br>jQuery will help you keep the file size down, create scripts faster and keep your code smaller. Often with jQuery you can write a single line of code to achieve what would have taken 10-20 lines of regular JavaScript code.
